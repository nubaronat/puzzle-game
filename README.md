The 8-puzzle problem is a famous question in the domains ofartificial intelligence and computer science. It includesmoving the tiles on a 3x3 board to reach a goal configuration taken from an initial one. In this paper, we describe the detailed implementation of the A* algorithm to accomplish the 8-puzzle problem in the most effective way. We will dive deeply into the nuts and bolts of our code design, talk about the states and solutions representation, and orchestrate carefully all of the classes, methods, and code blocks we added or modified.
